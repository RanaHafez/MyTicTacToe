# MY TIC TAC TOE 
### This is my implementation of the game tic tac toe using numpy.

## Content
### The game has 2 players. they can play with O or X. the game chooses which player plays with which symbol.
#### the algorithm used was very simple 
* prompt one user to enter the row and column of the location.
* check if the location entered is empty if not keep propting the user until they enter an available location.
* check if either the diagonal or the horizontal or the vertical has the same content 
* if yes break the loop and announce the winner
* if no then prompt the second user.
* and the same thing goes on until either there is a winner or there is no available location and no one wins
